AUTOMATED WEB APPLICATION TESTING

1.	Get familiar with Selenium WebDriver (http://www.seleniumhq.org/)

2.	Explore our WorkTime application. URL will be given later on the meeting

3.	Write a set of test cases (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_case) for the worktime application. The number of test is solely on your consideration.

4.	Using Selenium Webdriver and .net make an application (by your choice. For exampe console application) with automatic tests (so called test suite) that will follow the test cases from point 3

5. Keep in mind, that there is no way how to restore the database before each test suite run. On the other hand there is a need to allow multiple test suite runs. So make the application in a way that it could be run more than once and still produce meaningful test summary.
6. It would be best if you could pick each one of you a different person in the worktime app
